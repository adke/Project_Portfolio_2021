## Introduction
### Hello, Welcome to Adish's Coding Portfolio! 
#### I greatly appreciate the time and effort you are putting in to see my work. It took me a long time in organzing this masterpiece and so, I really do hope you enjoy and get a feel of some of my talents and skills in programming. Without further ado, let's get started with going over what this portfolio looks like.:sunglasses:
 
## Overview
#### This portfolio will contain projects and assignments that are based on Java. I have built projects that are based on python and web-development programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript however, those are more complex and harder for me to showcase at the moment because they are still a work in progress. So for the sake of simplicity, I have kept this portfolio Java-based only. HEY BUT C'MON, EVERYONE LOVES JAVA!:smile::satisfied:      

#### Anyways, all the work I have uploaded onto this portfolio has been stuff I worked on during a computer science course I participated in at my high school. This is work from semester 1 though, I am still apart of the CS course in semester 2 as I chose to do this course for a full year because coding is my passion!!!:blue_heart::purple_heart::green_heart::heart:
